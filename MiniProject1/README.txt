Author: Abigail Jackson

About:
This C program implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game with two game modes: player vs player and player vs AI. 
You can choose the board size (3-10) and the AI has basic logic to make the game more challenging.

Built With:
C programming language & Standard C libraries 

Getting Started:
1. Compile the code: Save the code as a c file (e.g., `tictactoe.c`) and compile it using a C compiler like GCC:
   gcc tictactoe.c -o tictactoe
2. Then make it an executable file to run the code in your terminal
    gcc tictactoe.c -o tictactoe.exe
3. Run your code in the terminal to play game:
    ./tictactoe.exe

Testing: 
1. Start by testing player vs player
- Try to set the grid to 11 to ensure error handling is being done properly
- then set board to 3
- play 3 times 
  - 1st time player 1 wins
  - 2nd time player 2 wins
  - 3rd time its a draw
- Then end that game
2. Then try the player vs AI
- start by setting up the AI to block a move
- Then try to set up the AI to win
